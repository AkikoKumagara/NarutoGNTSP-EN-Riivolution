# NarutoGNTSP-EN-Riivolution
My Riivolution port of Kosheh's English Translation patch of Naruto Shippuden: Gekitō Ninja Taisen! Special (-ナルト- 疾風伝 激闘忍者大戦! Special)

With this, you can now apply the patch to a clean copy of the game (or a disc copy) on the fly on console or in Dolphin. This was made by packing the translation files into .FPK format and will only override the FPK files.

## Instructions:

- Extract the archive on the Root of your SD card (or in your Dolphin Emulator "Load/Riivolution" directory; create one if it doesn't exist).
- Enable the File Replacement patch in Riivolution/Dolphin's Riivolution Settings (right click game, "Start with Riivolution Patches...", "Open Riivolution XML", Dropdown to Enabled)
- Launch the game and enjoy.
